# Already Completed
 - cipher-rs: Detection of mono-alphabetic ciphers/poly-alphabetic ciphers, solving of both whitespaced and block-aligned caesar, affine and keyword (based on wordlist) cipher
 - Frequency Analysis (basic ver)
 - Character Rearranger
 - Vigenere Cipher <- (Requires ciphertext and keyword to be input)
 - Vigener Cipher (With built-in Kasiski-Friedman tests) <- (Only requires ciphertext to be input)
# Being worked on
- Advanced Frequency Analysis (Shravan)
- Polybius (Kyan - other repo)
- Full monoalphabetic automatic deciphering
